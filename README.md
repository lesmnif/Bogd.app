# Bogd.app

Bogd.app is a progressive web app built with Next.js (React.js) and Tailwind.css.

Its main goal is to help people who work with kids to find the perfect game or song for their group of children. The app offers over 150 labeled activities, which can be filtered by age, number of participants, or type of label. You can also save your favorite activities and create your own songs or games to refer to later.

It is designed to be easy to use and helpful for those working with children in a variety of settings. Whether you are a parent, teacher, or youth group leader, Bogd.app has something for you. Give it a try and see how it can make your next outing with kids a success!
